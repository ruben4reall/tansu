#!/bin/bash
# scripts/release.sh [--check]: builds Tiroir for distribution and packs it in a branded disk image (the brand's light
# background, Tiroir on the left, Applications on the right, the volume icon), then hands over to
# scripts/finish-release.sh. Adapted from Pli's release script.
#
# On macOS 27 Tiroir must run from /Applications: MenuBarAgent only honours apps there, and the app offers to move itself
# at launch. Nothing changes for packaging: the disk image already asks for a drag to Applications, and Homebrew
# installs there.
#
# Two ways to sign:
# - Developer ID, notarized (what people download): set TIROIR_TEAM_ID to your Apple team, be signed in to Xcode with the
#   team's Account Holder (Xcode signs with a cloud-managed Developer ID certificate), and give notarytool an App Store
#   Connect API key through NOTARY_KEY_ID, NOTARY_ISSUER_ID and NOTARY_KEY_PATH (the .p8 file). The app, then the disk
#   image, are notarized and stapled. None of these values belongs in this repository.
# - Ad hoc (anyone, no Apple account): leave TIROIR_TEAM_ID unset. For local testing only: macOS asks to confirm the
#   first opening, the hardened runtime is off (library validation cannot load Sparkle into ad hoc code), the
#   Accessibility grant does not survive a rebuild, and nothing is prepared for publication.
#
# --check          runs the checks below (with a team, also asks Apple whether the key works), then stops.
# NOTARIZE_LATER=1 (Developer ID) submits the disk image without waiting; once Apple accepts it, run
#                  scripts/finish-release.sh <version>.
# TIROIR_APPCAST    the appcast to check against (default site/appcast.xml); the update rehearsal points it elsewhere.
#
# Output: dist/Tiroir-<version>.dmg and, with a team, dist/build-commit.txt (the commit it was built from).
