# scripts/publish.sh <release|tap|site> <version> [--confirm <version>]
#
# The publication steps of a release, in this order, once scripts/release.sh (and finish-release.sh) are done. Each one
# needs Ruben's go-ahead: in a terminal it asks for the version to be typed; an agent passes --confirm <version> only
# after Ruben has said yes to that step in the conversation.
#   release  tags the commit the app was built from as v<version>, pushes the tag, publishes the GitHub release with
#            both disk images, then checks that the published files are the ones the appcast signs
#   tap      pushes the release's cask to ruben4reall/homebrew-tap, once the published download matches its SHA-256
#   site     deploys site/ to Vercel production in the scope TANSU_VERCEL_SCOPE names (the maintainer's personal scope,
#            never a team), checks the live appcast, then commits and pushes it
